### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Hirwa Blessing and I'm an experienced, detailed-oriented, front-end web developer based in Kigali, Rwanda. As you'll see, I have four years of hands-on experience efficiently coding fun, creative and fast websites and applications using modern web technologies. I try to leave every snippet of code I touch more readable and even accessible than I found it.

I'm passionate about turning wireframes of the UX designer to life, building a state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications using web technologies like React, Ionic React and React Native.
